## Project Description 

Pixelate is an inclusive pixel-art sprite editor designed to help colorblind artists with its unique accessibility features. Existing image editing tools on the market do not offer support for color-vision deficiencies, which more than 300 million people are afflicted with worldwide.  Pixelate addresses this issue by offering tools such as an AI conversational assistant, vision filters, and approximation tools tailored to the three most common types of colorblindness: protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia. Additionally, we foster community engagement through our custom gallery feature. It is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that we introduce to you, Pixelate!

## Features 
* Create Pixel Art: Design pixel art with an intuitive interface and save it as a custom .pix file.
* Upload and Share: Upload your pixel art to our custom gallery and share with others.
* Like/Unlike Sprites: Authenticated users can like or unlike sprites in the gallery, with likes tracked in Firestore.
* Public Gallery: All uploaded sprites are publicly accessible for viewing and downloading by anyone.
* Secure Authentication: Uses Firebase Authentication to manage user logins and ensure secure access to user-specific data.
